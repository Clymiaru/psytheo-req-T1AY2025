## Overview
Assumes that the whole person is constantly being motivated by one need or another and that people have the potential to grow toward psychological health to **self-actualization**.

To attain **self-actualization**, people must *satisfy lower-level needs*. Only after they are *relatively satisfied* in each of *these needs* can they reach **self-actualization**.

![Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/wp-content/uploads/Maslows-Hierarchy-8-Levels-1024x1024.jpeg)

Assumptions of motivation for this theory:
 - Holistic approach to motivation
 - Motivation is usually complex
 - People are continually motivated by one need or another
 - All people everywhere are motivated by the same basic needs
 - Needs can be arranged on a hierarchy

Four dimensions of needs
- Conative (willful striving)
- Aesthetic (need for order and beauty)
- Cognitive (the need for curiosity and knowledge)
- Neurotic (unproductive pattern of relating to people)

Conative needs are arranged in a heirarchy.
- Physiological
- safety
- love and belongingness
- esteem
- self-actualization

Occasionally, needs of the hierarchy can be reversed, and they are frequently unconscious.

Coping behavior is motivated and is directed toward the satisfaction of basic needs.

Expressive behavior has a cause but is not motivated. It is simply one's way of expressing oneself

Conative needs, including self-actualization, are instinctoid. Their depravation leads to pathology.

B-values = "Being" values
- called "metaneeds" = ultimate level of needs

Metamotivation = expressive rather than coping behavior and is associated with the B-values

Maslow (1964, 1970) identified 14 B-values, but the exact number is not impor tant because ultimately all become one, or at least all are highly correlated. The values of self-actualizing people include truth, goodness, beauty, wholeness or the transcendence of dichotomies, aliveness or spontaneity, uniqueness, perfection, completion, justice and order, simplicity, richness or totality, effortlessness, playfulness or humor, and self sufficiency or autonomy

The frustration of self-actualization needs results in metapathology and a rejection of the B-values

Acceptance of B-values (truth, beauty, humor,. etc) is the criterion that separates self-actualizing people from those who are merely healthy but mired at the level of esteem

Characteristics of self-actualizers
- More efficient perception of reality
- Acceptance of self, others, and nature
- Spontaneity, simplicity, and naturalness
- A problem-centered approach to life
- The need for privacy
- Autonomy
- freshness of appreciation
- peak experiences
- social interest
- profound interpersonal relations
- a democratic attitude
- the ability to discriminate means from ends
- philosophical sense of humor
- creativeness 
- resistance to enculturation

The Jonah complex = fear of being or doing one's best
