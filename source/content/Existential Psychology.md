## Overview

People living in the world of present experiences and ultimately being responsible for who they become.

Many people lack the courage to face their destiny, and in the process of fleeing from it, they gave up much of their freedom which may urge them to run away from their responsibility.

Not being willing to make choices, they lose sight of who they are and develop a sense of insignificance and alienation.

In contrast, healthy people challenge their destiny, cherish their freedom, and live authentically with other people and with themselves. They recognize the inevitability of death and have the courage to live life in the present.

Basic tenet of existentialism = existence precedes essence which means what people do is more important than what they are

Assumptions
- People are both subjective and objective
- People are motivated to search for answers to important questions regarding the meaning of life
- People have an equal degree of both freedom and responsibility

The unity of people and their phenomenological world is expressed by the term Dasein, or being in the world.

Modes of being in the world
- Umwelt = One's relationship with the world of things
- Mitwelt = One's relationship with the world of people
- Eigenwelt = One's relationship with oneself

Nonbeing is an awareness of the possibility of one's not being, through death or loss of awareness

People experience anxiety when they are aware of the possibility of their nonbeing as well as when they are aware that they are free to choose.

Normal anxiety = experienced by everyone and is proportional to threat
Neurotic anxiety = is disproportionate to threat, involves repression, and is handled in a self-defeating manner

People experienced guilt as a result
- Separation from the natural world
- Inability to judge the needs of others
- Denial of own potentials

Intentionality = underlying structure that gives meaning to experience and allows people to make decisions for the future

Love = taking delight in the presence of other person and affirming that person's value as much as their own

Sex = basic form of love, seeks satisfaction through the release of sexual tension

Eros = Higher form of love, seeks union with a loved one

Philia = form of love that seeks a nonsexual friendship

Agape = highest form of love, is altruistic (emphatic)

Freedom = gained through confrontation with one's destiny

Existential Freedom = freedom of action

Essential Freedom = freedom of being

Cultural myths are belief systems that provide explanations for personal and social problems
